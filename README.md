# The Last Lisp Project: Logic Solver Production System
Artificial Intelligence with Lisp
Spring 2019
Your last project is to design a logic puzzle solver in Lisp. With any given logic puzzle, you will have to develop a sequence of constraints based on the clues provided by the puzzle. Using these constraints, your program is to search through the state space to locate and print out the solution to the puzzle.

Submission requirements:
  Self-documenting code
  In a folder include the following 6 files:
    Program file (use MAIN as the driving function with no arguments)
    Two text files, each representing the constraints you developed from the clues of two logic puzzles
    Explanation of the format of your text files (so someone else can convert the clues from a different logic puzzle to test your program)
    Copies of the two logic puzzles your text files represent
  Submit your folder (named by your last name) in the appropriate folder in my Hand-In folder
