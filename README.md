# Logic Solver Production System
Your last project is to design a logic puzzle solver in Lisp. With any given logic puzzle, you will have to develop a sequence of constraints based on the clues provided by the puzzle. Using these constraints your program is to search through the state space to locate and print out the solution to the puzzle.
